# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

The goal of this project is to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains images of various clothing items (T-shirts, trousers, dresses, shoes, etc.), and the model aims to classify them correctly. The challenge is to achieve **high accuracy** while maintaining **efficiency**.

## DESIGN STEPS

#### STEP 1: Problem Statement  
Define the objective of classifying fashion items (T-shirts, trousers, dresses, shoes, etc.) using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  

#### STEP 2: Dataset Collection  
Use the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, which contains **60,000** training images and **10,000** test images of various clothing items.  

#### STEP 3: Data Preprocessing  
Convert images to tensors, normalize pixel values, and create **DataLoaders** for batch processing.  

#### STEP 4: Model Architecture  
Design a CNN with **convolutional layers**, **activation functions**, **pooling layers**, and **fully connected layers** to extract features and classify clothing items.  

#### STEP 5: Model Training  
Train the model using a suitable **loss function** (**CrossEntropyLoss**) and **optimizer** (**Adam**) for multiple epochs.  

#### STEP 6: Model Evaluation  
Test the model on unseen data, compute **accuracy**, and analyze results using a **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.  

#### STEP 7: Model Deployment & Visualization  
Save the trained model, visualize predictions, and integrate it into an application if needed.
